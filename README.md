 - An administration interface to configure slideshow settings.
 - Simple slider positioning using the Backdrop block system.

Backdrop core modules

INSTALLATION
------------

To install Nivo Slider:

 - Download the latest version of the Nivo Slider jQuery plugin
   (http://dev7studios.com/nivo-slider/) and extract it to a 
   /libraries folder in the root of your Backdrop install. The
   extracted folder must be named nivo-slider.
 - Enable Nivo Slider.
 - Add a 'Nivo Slider' block to your desired layout and region in Layout 
   Builder using the 'Add Block' button. Choose a name for this slider instance.
 - Go to the Layout's path and, in the region you placed your block find the
   link which says "No slides yet. Add slides." and follow this link to add 
   slides. Use the "Options" local tasks tab to change options.

PERMISSIONS
------------

Nivo Slider provides one permission:

 - Administer Nivo Slider
    Allows a user to configure slider options and the available slides.

USAGE
-----

Nivo Slider provides a block which will determine where the slider is placed.

Administrators or users with the Administer Nivo Slider permission will be able
to configure slider settings by visiting the Nivo Slider administration page 
(admin/structure/nivo-slider).

Nivo Slider provides two configuration pages: slides and options.
 - Slides
    The slides page provides an interface for managing the content of the
    slider. Slider content can be given a title or description, made into a
    link, reordered or restricted to displaying on a specific path.
 - Options
    The options page provides an interface for configuring the slider. Slider
    options include general options, transitions and navigation.
